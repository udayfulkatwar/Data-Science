# Data Science Lab

## Overview

This repository is a collection of data science experiments, notes, and code samples primarily in Jupyter Notebook, R, and Python. It serves as a lab space for exploring various concepts in data analysis, machine learning, statistical modeling, and related topics.

| Sr. No. | Title |
|:--------:|:------|
| 1 | To study basic vector operations in R programming |
| 2 | To perform explicit and implicit type conversion on vectors and perform label/one-hot encoding on categorical variables |
| 3 | To study useful functions like sample(), subset(), ifelse(), ggplot() etc. and work with different parameters in sample() function |
